            <h1>Howdy! I'm Sean.</h1>
            <p>A junior in computer engineering at A&M University graduating in May 2022.  
                I would love to apply what Iâ€™ve been learning in my engineering and programming courses within a challenging and learning environment.  
                I can program in Python, have been learning about data analysis and visualization (Tibco Spotfire/Tableau), and am a little bit of a wizard in excel.  
                I have been working regularly since high school and can provide great references that will reassure you of my work ethic, diligence and professionalism.</p>
