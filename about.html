        <p>Hi! I am currently a Senior Computer Engineering 
undergraduate at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. Some of my hobbies
 include cooking, home automation, and cybersecurity.

            I recently completed a IT internship at Phillips 66,
            one of the most popular downstream Oil Companies in the global industry. 
            During my time there, I conducted a Proof of Concept evaluation of some exciting
            new technology - AWS Monitron - to vet whether or not it might add value to the 
            Lubricants business, and potentially the Refining business. I met regularly with 
            on-site personel, department leads, and team members of the Amazon Monitron team.
            Additionally, I automated a few workflows to save time and provide insight into lubricants sales, minimizing profit loss.
            My experience at Phillips not only taught me about the business, but how it was run. I got to 
            meet with C-level executives such as Zhanna Golodryga - Chief Digital & Administrative Officer. 
            Such opportunities are what make me so incredibly grateful for this experience.

            Before then, I had the fortunate chance to participate in Texas A&M's Aggie Research Program, where 
            I worked with a team of 6 people to processing .fits images from NASA's Hubble and Swift Satellites.
            Each image captured by a satellite would have a good deal of 'noise', or what appeared as a dusty cloud
            stretching across the image, making it hazy and unclear. Our task was to 'clean' the image of this noise without degrading image quality, keeping
            stars and galaxies resolute and intact. To do this we wrote a series of python scripts utilizing a number of libraries, namely astropy. 
            After the project was complete, we presented our results to a panel of judges, composed of faculty and former NASA employees, and won the award Aggie Research Scholar.

            Outside of school, I've kept busy. Working consistently either at my first job (Fajita Pete's) or my personal projects. 
            I like it at Fajita Pete's because of Pete himself and the people surrounding him. They've helped me learn many life lessons that
            all contribute to what I see as solid character. Originally, I was just a cashier. But as time went on I was given more and 
            more responsibility, sometimes locking up. When they opened a location in College Station, I was heavily relied when the owners
            weren't present, and my ability in the front of house as well as the kitchen were constantly in use. My experience working with customers
            as well as being faced with overseeing all operations, end-to-end, have taught me to handle such situations, present and future.

            Since my freshman year, I've also been a part of the <a href="https://tx.ag/tamuisa">International Student Association</a>. One of 13 organizations Sponsored by the University.
            I initially joined as a member, but increasingly found more and more opportunities for responsibility. Soon I became an Officer, a position I held 
            until a position for Vice President unexpectedly opened up. I jumped at the opportunity, and then covid hit. Despite the challenges it posed, my team 
            and I were still able to organize successfull events & programs. Later, I  was voted President for the following year, which was still fully online due to covid. 
            I felt the experience did not yield as much growth as I would have hoped. So, I ran for President a second year and have been serving in that role
            ever since. A year I was not expecting to be as historical as it has been, with the President of the University cleaning house and changing things everywhere, 
            with some of those decisions inciting backlash from the student body. Needless to say, representing all 7000+ International Students throughout this time has been
            paramount. And my experiences in leadership & public speaking have helped me grow in ways I cannot express in words
        </p>

            I also enjoy a number of hobbies, namely hydroponics, cooking, and recurve archery. My interest in hydroponics came about when I 
            started cooking neopolitan style pizzas from scratch. Part of a classic neopolitan pizza is to top it with fresh basil. And basil 
            gets expensive when you're buying it every week. So, inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aaIwTB1aRY">Jeb Gardener</a> 
            I started to grow my own basil. Taking it a step further, I sought to automate the process seeing as the most complex task was 
            creating a EC and PH balanced nutrient solution, something I knew a series of pumps, tubes, and SCBs could accomplish with even more accuracy than me.
