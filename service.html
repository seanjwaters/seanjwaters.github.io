        <p>When I went to Carnegie Vanguard High School in Houston, I'd volunteer annually at the Houston Food bank. 
            To me, it was the best way to have a large impact with the amount of time I had to spare.</p>
        <p>During the summer of 2019, I worked at a summer camp helping to teach kids about a number of skills. 
            Many had to do with aquatics, but the one I enjoyed the most was teaching Archery, as I've been a recurve archer for a few years now.</p>
