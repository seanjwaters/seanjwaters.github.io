                    My life in middle and high school revolved around 
competing in Speech and Debate. I was enchanted with the process of 
speaking in front of crowds, 
                    preparing impromptu speeches, and debating against 
like-minded opponents. Once my time was up, I wanted to give back and 
teach the skills that I had 
                    learned from my time competing. During my summers, I
 coached middle school students on how to better engage in their 
speaking events, giving advice on 
                    how best to approach different speaking situations. I
 also personally counseled students who needed some extra support and 
motivation to speak in front of 
                    larger crowds.

                Whenever possible, I try to help members of my community
 in their schoolwork. Recently, due to COVID, many of my peers have 
found it hard to keep up in their
                STEM classes, citing that the material is often too hard
 to grasp when working alone in their houses. I sympathize with this as I
 often had trouble in these classes
                as well during middle and high school. Once a week, I 
host a group Zoom meeting in which members of my local mosque can ask me
 questions about material that they are 
                learning in class that they find challenging.

                    Reading <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/" target="_blank">The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</a>
 gave me a newfound respect for the open-source community. Now
                    that I feel confident in myself as a programmer, I 
believe it is my responsibility to give back to the community that 
helped me learn so much. In my free time, I 
                    aim to start contributing to various open-source 
projects listed <a href="https://up-for-grabs.net/#/filters?tags=python" target="_blank">here</a> that may need some extra helping 
                    hands to keep the ball rolling.
