                International Student Association
                <p>
                    Throughout all my time at Texas A&M, I've been a part of the International Student Association. 
                    First as a member, then an Officer, then a Vice President, and finally as President of the organization.
                    All the while accomplishing our mission: to promote cultural awareness on campus, advocate for our International 
                    Aggies, and develop our members into global leaders. In my most recent role, I've been able to have the most impact 
                    pushing our mission. On advocacy, I've met with students to hear their problems, student leaders to find solutions, and members of the administration
                    to discuss those solutions. On promoting cultural awareness, we have annual programs in the Fall and Spring semesters. In the fall we teach 
                    our International Aggies about American Football and give them a chance to experience Tailgating. 
                    In the Spring, we have our signature program - International Week - where we have an event every day, including exhibitions, performances, buffets, and henna.
                    Everything involves countless man-hours of planning from our Officers and those who we collaborate with. 
                    For our members, we offer professional development opportunities, ranging from mock interviews, to resume workshops, to unique speakers.
