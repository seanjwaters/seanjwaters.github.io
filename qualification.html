            <strong>Technical Areas of Interest</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cybersecurity
                    <p>  My time in Cryptography and Networking classes as well as my conversations 
                        with the CISO of Phillips 66 has fostered my excitement for cybersecurity,
                        and helped me see its necessity in enterprise architecture. I've invested 
                        countless hours exploring the subject and am eager to learn more in a real-world  and  mathematics and my 
                        experience in the Aggie Research Program made me see the benefit that 
                        algorithms could bring in making software more efficient. I am fascinated 
                        with the subject and am constantly trying to learn more about how I can 
                        apply the knowledge that I gained into my software development today. 
                    </p>

                <li>Home Automation & Design
                    <p>
                        From the bedroom to the backyard, I want to automate as many closed system functions as I can.
                         And I'm interested in using Single Board Computers to help do this, making everyday routines simpler and saving time.
                    </p>
