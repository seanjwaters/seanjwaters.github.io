                Ethereum GPU Mining Rig
                <p>
                    I used my entire internship savings to invest in the hardware and software needed 
                    to build an ethereum mining rig. It uses a custom unix-based OS and required extensive 
                    configuration of the physical system to enable the use of 8 graphics cards. 
                    One key concern was safety, and ensuring the overall power draw was safe.

                            My freshman year, I found myself on a small team helping Dr. Peter Brown
                            filter throuhg .fits image data. My team and I were tasked with automating
                            a portion of his workflow, specifically the part where he manually goes through
                            each image to filter out the "background noise" that gets captured in satellite
                            images, which appears as a dusty cloud, stretching over the whole picture.
                            While basic graphics filters would make the image clearer, it would also degrade 
                            the quality. Using the python astropy library among others, we were able to 
                            remove the noise and retain image quality. Some of our results can be seen

                Custom Keyboard

                        Building a custom keyboard is another way I gained experience with pcbs and soldering next 
                        to my Proxmark 3 & Boosted Board. To build the custom wooden keyboard case I designed the 
                        model in Rhino 3D, generating the gcode in DeskProto, and routing the design on a full size 
                        CNC router. It was particularly tricky implementing a 5 degree angle.

                This Website!
                <p>
                    The website that you are currently using has been by first foray into using HTML/CSS. 
                    This was originally assigned to me as a project in my Design Studio class, which I am 
                    thankful for because it helped me gain the confidence I need to work on future projects.

                Synchronized Sensors for Vehicle Autopilot
                    <p>
                        This was my Senior Capstone project, where my team and I synchronized a Lidar and 
                        Camera sensor to the PPS signal of a Reach M2 GPS. To do this, we used the RIAPs 
                        platform, hosted on a BeagleBone Black, to process the GPS PPS signal and output 
                        that to our Lidar and Camera sensors, synchronizing their output frequency for the 'Autodrive'  system.

                RFID Fob Duplicator
                    <p>
                        Losing my Apartment FOB key meant spending 50$ to replace it with the complex. 
                        Of course, the fob itself can't be worth 50$. Why should having a spare key cost 50$? 
                        So I bought a Proxmark RDV4 kit - a portable open source RFID tool. This tool 
                        combined with a Kali-based Linux environment called ParrotSec, gave way to my discovery of 
                        enterprise architecture and its complexity. I realized my interest and subsequently 
                        enrolled in some relevant classes for my final semester.
